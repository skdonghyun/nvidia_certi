# Lesson 12.2 - Introduction to AI in the Cloud

0:00
This sub-unit introduces the concept of AI in Cloud computing environments. As AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into enterprise operations. The challenge of building and maintaining a robust AI infrastructure has become a critical factor for determining success in the AI era. Design complexity is a major challenge in AI infrastructure. As AI models become more sophisticated, they require more powerful hardware and specialized software to train and run. This complexity can lead to unpredictable performance and scalability issues. Deploying an AI infrastructure can be a lengthy and complex process. It involves procuring, installing, and integrating multiple technologies, including hardware, software, and networking components. This can lead to delays and increased costs. Training and ramping up day-to-day production is a critical aspect of AI infrastructure. It requires a significant amount of data, computing power, and expertise to train AI models and ensure they're performing accurately. Additionally, as AI models are continuously improved and updated, it can be challenging to ramp up production to meet the demands of the business.
