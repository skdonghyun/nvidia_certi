Let's start with the on-premises model as a baseline for comparing cloud consumption models. In a traditional on premises deployment, the customer is responsible for managing the entire technology stack, from the data center and network infrastructure to storage, physical servers, virtualization, operating systems scaling, application code and data configuration. Cloud delivery models primarily differ in the division of responsibilities between the customer and the cloud service provider for managing the full stack of resources required to run a workload. This contrasts with traditional on-premises infrastructure where the customer is responsible for managing the entire data center. In cloud computing, infrastructure as a service, IaaS provides on-demand infrastructure services managed by the cloud service provider or CSP, with the customer responsible for elements beyond infrastructure. Platform as a service, PaaS builds on IaaS, letting developers focus on coding while CSP manages both hardware and software. Software as a service, SaaS delivers complete applications with the CSP handling all hosting components. Importantly, the level of responsibility shifts between the CSP and the customer depending on the consumption model. To effectively leverage AI in the cloud, the first step is to understand your company's current cloud strategy and how they're using the cloud today. This includes understanding any enterprise cloud contracts in place and the specific cloud services being used, such as IaaS or PaaS. This foundation will inform how AI can be leveraged to maximize benefits. With a solid grasp of the cloud consumption models, let's dive into one of the most popular options for getting started with cloud computing.
